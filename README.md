# SpeedyLoop

The class "Digraph" contains the algorithms to calculate distance with a given route ("distanceFromRoute"), count total possible trips given a maximum amount of stops ("countTripsWithMaxStops"), calculate shortest distance between two towns ("shortestDistance"), and count total possible trips given a maximum amount of distance ("countTripsWithMaxDistance").

Digraph has 3 constructors: Digraph(String routesStr), Digraph(Path filePath), and Digraph(String... routes).
